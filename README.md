# Some basic Swift Examples

-Multiplication Flash Card: generates infinitely many 2-digit by 2-digit multiplication problems

-Progress Bar Practice: animated circular progress bar, and animated versions of the native Swift progress views

-Buckets Animation Practice: My first animation project, filling other buckets with other buckets. Also programatically added all elements with no Storyboard involvement. All assets and images created in InkScape.

-Useful Swift Stuff Collection: Easily rounding corners and editing borders on buttons, images, and textFields. Making the background an image. Making the navBar clear. Handling keyboard problems when editing text fields. Quick pull-to-refresh element for tableViews. More to come.
