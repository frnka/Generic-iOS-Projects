# Some Quick, Fun Swift Examples

-Multiplication Flash Card: generates infinitely many 2-digit by 2-digit multiplication problems

-Progress Bar Practice: animated circular progress bar, and animated versions of the native Swift progress views

-Buckets Animation Practice: My first animation project, filling other buckets with other buckets. Also programatically added all elements with no Storyboard involvement. All assets and images created in InkScape.

-Useful Swift Stuff Collection: Easily rounding corners and editing borders on buttons, images, and textFields. Making the background an image. Making the navBar clear. Handling keyboard problems when editing text fields. Quick pull-to-refresh element for tableViews. More to come.

-Verbal Flash Cards: Imports some words and definitions from a csv file, stores them in a dictionary, and then displays them at random. The third view controller has a flip action so you see word on front and definition on "back".
