# Some basic Swift Examples

-Multiplication Flash Card: generates infinitely many 2-digit by 2-digit multiplication problems

-Progress Bar Practice: animated circular progress bar, and animated versions of the native Swift progress views

-Buckets Animation Practice: My first animation project, filling other buckets with other buckets. Also programatically added all elements with no Storyboard involvement. All assets and images created in InkScape.
