# Some Quick, Fun Swift Examples

-Multiplication Flash Card: generates infinitely many 2-digit by 2-digit multiplication problems

-Progress Bar Practice: animated circular progress bar, and animated versions of the native Swift progress views

-Buckets Animation Practice: My first animation project, filling other buckets with other buckets. Also programatically added all elements with no Storyboard involvement. All assets and images created in InkScape.

-Useful Swift Stuff Collection: Easily rounding corners and editing borders on buttons, images, and textFields. Making the background an image. Making the navBar clear. Handling keyboard problems when editing text fields. Quick pull-to-refresh element for tableViews. More to come.

-Verbal Flash Cards: Imports some words and definitions from a csv file, stores them in a dictionary, and then displays them at random. The third view controller has a flip action so you see word on front and definition on "back". 

-Side Scroller: Experimenting with another level of Table View with multiple dynamic prototype cells. Utilizes the CollectionView embedded in the tableViewCell tutorial from https://github.com/ThornTechPublic. Just a quick test before implementing it in a live project. Basic elements of "Swipe and Share" are in the second tableView controller if you can find it.

-MVC Hacks: Has a couple of animations, a Date Picker example, CollectionView Example, and some other things.
